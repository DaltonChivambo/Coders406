# Coders406

Welcome to **Coders406** - A collaborative development group focused on building innovative solutions and contributing to the tech community.

## About Us

**Coders406** was formed during the **"Hackathon Tráfico de Pessoas"** organized by the **United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)**, the **Faculty of Sciences of Eduardo Mondlane University**, and the **Knowledge Foundation**. Our team came together with a shared mission to develop technological solutions to prevent and combat human trafficking in Mozambique.

We are a group of passionate developers committed to using technology for social good, combining our programming skills with social awareness to create meaningful impact in our community.

## 🌍 Our Origin - UNODC Hackathon Tráfico de Pessoas

Our group was established as part of an important initiative to combat human trafficking through technology innovation. The hackathon was co-organized by:

- **UNODC** (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime)
- **Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade Eduardo Mondlane**
- **Knowledge Foundation**
- With support from the **Kingdom of Norway**

### About Human Trafficking
Human trafficking is a serious crime involving the recruitment, transport, transfer, harboring, or receipt of individuals through force, fraud, or deception for the purpose of exploitation and profit. This widespread crime affects men, women, and children of all ages and backgrounds worldwide, with traffickers often resorting to violence, fraudulent employment agencies, or false promises of education and job opportunities to deceive and coerce their victims.

### The Initiative
Recognizing the intersection between digital innovation and entrepreneurship for social causes, UNODC has conducted hackathons in various countries on diverse matters, including Human Trafficking in Colombia (2019) and Canada (2021). This initiative in Mozambique aims to engage young innovators in developing technology-based solutions to combat human trafficking.

### Event Structure
The hackathon consisted of:

1. **📚 Bootcamp** (October 13-17, 2025): Participants received training on relevant topics
2. **💻 3-day Hackathon** (October 28-30, 2025): Intensive development period at the Faculty of Sciences, Eduardo Mondlane University
3. **🏆 Awards Ceremony** (October 30, 2025): Recognition of innovative solutions

This experience not only allowed us to apply our programming and technology skills for social benefit but also deepened our understanding of human trafficking while developing crucial social, leadership, and technical skills.
