The Localized Audio Visual DeepFake (LAV-DF) dataset is a specialized collection designed to enhance research in deepfake detection. It features a wide array of videos where both audio and visual elements have been manipulated, focusing on localized alterations to simulate more sophisticated and subtle deepfake scenarios. This dataset serves as a critical resource for developing and evaluating multi-modal detection models, providing researchers with the tools to address the growing complexity of deepfake technologies.
